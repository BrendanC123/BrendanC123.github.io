								<h2>Being the Tech Lead</h2>
								<p>This group project consisted of artists, designers, animators, and the tech team. Each of these disciplines were made up of two years 2nd year and 3rd year students. The 2nd year students were the juniors, and the 3rd year students were the seniors. In the tech team there were 3 members me, another senior and a junior, as well as some members of the design team who helped out in some areas. Between me and the other senior it was decided that I would take the role of tech lead as I was more vocal and had less of a problem conversing with other members of the team.</p>
								<p>In the initial week when the design team was pitching initial ideas, I created both a written and video demo for how to use GitHub as some members hadn’t used it before and some hadn’t used it as a team. </p>
								<p>After the game idea had been finalized, I was responsible for delegating tasks to other members of the team. Because the junior had prior experience creating AI and as the AI needed for this project was very simple, I gave it to them. The design team wanted the cleaning of the level to be an important part of the gameplay loop and as none of the tech team had any prior experience with creating something like this, I instructed the other senior to look into how other cleaning games go about creating their systems. On top of this, a designer expressed to me a big desire to create the wave spawning system, so I allowed him to take that on. With all these tasks delegated, I decided to get started creating the base components of the game that being: the player, the weapon, the game mode, and the interaction system.</p>
								<p>The interaction system was designed so that other designers could easily create their own interactables easily and in blueprint if they needed as they didn’t have much programming experience.</p>
								<p>In the end what I contributed to the project was the player, weapon, game mode, interaction system, UI, score system, save system, leaderboard, doors, levers, upgrades, the shop, and the shop manager. As well as helping bug fix for anyone who asked for help. Most of the systems I created were in C++ but as the project neared deadline I did some work in blueprints to get a working prototype for these systems submitted.</p>
